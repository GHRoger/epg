This film sheds light on the pivotal historical events that led to Aboriginal Land Rights and forever changed our nation and the plight of Indigenous people to reclaim their land. It does so by revisiting the Gurindji community all these years later to hear from the descendants of Vincent Lingiari, and those who took a brave stand against power and privilege some 54 years ago.</desc><category lang="en">Documentary</category><rating system="ACB"><value>PG</value></rating></programme>
