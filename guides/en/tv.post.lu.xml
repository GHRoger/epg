As a writer, he is the only member of the group who isn&apos;t a professional builder but that doesn&apos;t stop him getting his hands dirty and applying some elbow grease to the task in hand. The men and women who volunteer to apply their skills would be able to construct a house from scratch, but usually the task is confined to the business of fitting adaptations and devices that are required by people already in residence. It is no mean feat, where properties do not always lend themselves to simple renovation work. The viewers tune in to get some useful tips on house transformation, and see the techniques and insider tricks of the trade that make a seemingly impossible task achievable by the professionals.</desc><category lang="en">Info</category><icon src="https://mp-photos-cdn.azureedge.net/container3cc71e4948ac40ab803c26e0abc2e3e5/original/da07fd0365c4e3894b7c3d6b257c943624f50864.jpg"/></programme>

They hide beneath the surface, in the intricate underwater world of the Delta. Fearsome hippos and man-eating crocodiles guard these waters, and diving here is considered extremely dangerous. Few humans have ever ventured below the surface, until now. A team of film makers armed with experience and a deep knowledge of animal behaviour have dived the delta for the past year. Their experiences reveal a new, unexplored wilderness that is shaped by passage of the delta&apos;s epic winter flood. Every summer, rains that collect in Angola surge down the Okavango River in a giant pulse. Just as the dry season draws near, that pulse reaches the delta, and sets a chain reaction of life in motion. Landscapes flood as the pulse pushes through, and drain in its wake. These forces shape the lives of every creature in the underwater Okavango. The first to feel the effects of the flood are the cave dwellers. The rising tide lifts vast floating carpets of reeds and papyrus off the sand, creating a labyrinth of caves beneath them. Mormyrids and squeakers hunt in the dark, but the live in fear of a far larger predator. Sharp toothed catfish are amongst the Delta&apos;s most voracious hunters. They plague the smaller fish, but they in turn are hunted by giant crocodiles. As the pulse pushes into the main delta, tiny fish are sucked into the deep channels behind it. The waters fill with predators that gather to feast on the soup of small fry. The flood keeps pushing further and further out into Botswana, until in the peak of the dry season, it breaks out over dry land. Creatures travel from across Botswana to meet the life-giving tide. Huge elephant breeding herds flee the drought-stricken Kalahari, and walk hundreds of kilometres to reach the flooded delta. Though the water offers life, it harbours death as well. Their tiny infants must navigate crocodile infested floodplains, and face off with lions in the dense reeds. Nowhere is safe, until the flood finally reaches the end of its journey. Just as the rains threaten to bring the dry season to a close, the closing act of the underwater delta launches into action. Birds flock to the disappearing shallows to feast on trapped fish, and the fearsome catfish amass into an army. They charge down the channels by the hundred, and flush fish from the reeds. The stampede of hunters makes the water boil, and entices a new killer to the feast. Fish eagles swoop down one after the other, and snatch catfish from the churning waters. The frenzy of predators builds to a crescendo, until rains finally douse the feast. The wet season marks the end of the flood, but it feeds the beginnings of another. As rainwaters gather once more in the Angolan highlands, the journey of a new pulse begins. This film opens a window on an unexplored landscape of exquisite beauty, and the creatures that must play the daily lottery of life and death within it.</desc><category lang="en">Info</category></programme>

These likeable creatures have inspired and enthralled us through the ages and have seemingly secured their place beside us as one of the most intelligent mammals on the planet. But how do we measure this intelligence? And how smart are dolphins really? If intelligence is defined by the ability to reason, plan, solve problems and learn from experience, how does the dolphin weigh up? &quot;Dolphins – Beauty Before Brains?&quot; (1 x 52&apos; HD), takes us on a scientific journey into the complex world of the dolphin and investigates the controversy surrounding Professor Paul Manger&apos;s recent assertion that dolphins are not quite as smart as we&apos;d previously thought – &quot;dumber than a goldfish&quot; were the words he used. According to his studies, dolphins appear to have brains that lack complexity at neuronal level, which compromises their information-processing abilities. By examining a series of experiments testing the &quot;theory of mind&quot; in dolphins and exploring unique and engaging habits like self-awareness, creative responses and self-entertainment such as wave-riding, this film illustrates exactly where dolphin IQ scores on the charts. We also look at unique behaviour patterns, pod dynamics, communication skills and hunting strategies that play out in mass feeding events such as the Sardine Run on the South African coastline. The dolphins&apos; Sardine Run behaviour is one of the most amazing spectacles of intelligence and co-operation in the natural world. We then travel to Mozambique to meet Angie Gullan, the &quot;Dolphin Whisperer&quot;. She has monitored and interacted with four local pods for the past ten years and facilitates dolphin &quot;swims&quot; that are said to have physiological healing effects on human beings. According to her observations, dolphins rank at the top when it comes to emotional intelligence. So is Professor Manger correct in his assessment of dolphins and how does his study compare with the facts? Could dolphin intelligence, or lack thereof, be something that varies from one individual to the next?</desc><category lang="en">Nature + Travels</category></programme>

Aspiring chefs and restaurateurs Marida Mohammed (MasterChef) and her twin sister, Narida, get advice from celebrity chef and sommelier Vikram Vij, about how to select and appreciate wine and why they shouldn&apos;t worry too much about purported health threats. Marida and Narida then tour Niagara vineyards and compare super-‐organic, biodynamic wine with its conventional counterpart. Ann Sperling of Southbrook Vineyards combines cosmic forces with organic farming to produce wine she calls the purest expression of the grape that is good for the people who drink it and the planet as a whole. French winemaker JL Groux of Stratus Vineyards and George Soleas, the Vice President of the LCBO argue that conventional wine is delicious and safe for both you and the environment. Which one will the sisters choose?</desc><category lang="en">Info</category></programme>

According to pessimistic evaluations the chances of this threatened species to survive seem rather limited. The main reason for their extinction is that their natural habitat is being destroyed for the more profitable cultivation of palm oil plantations. By today already 70 % of the Sumatran Island is already covered by palm oil trees. In addition most of the local population sees them more as an object of entertainment rather than a national heritage which is worth being protected. Since that common attitude in society is even changing it could still come too late for those anthropoid apes. Ian Singleton who moved here from England is dedicating his life to the care of these apes.

From Tic-Tac-Dough in 1956 to Jeopardy in 1967 to Trivial Pursuit in 1993, they competed on national television 28 times -- probably the longest-running record of individual TV game show appearances by husband and wife in the world. Daughter Patricia melds 10 different TV game shows and a snappy soundtrack with vivid motion graphics and vintage footage to paint an intimate portrait of her quirky parents, paradigms of 20th century family life. Yet -- as their poignant romance and ribald experiences reveal the fascinating historical context of their times -- the winning couple also come to be seen as curiously-relatable outsiders to mainstream culture. Themes of love, hardship, and achievement add emotional weight to Bernard&apos;s parting words, &apos;If it&apos;s a lucky life, it&apos;s mine.&apos; Quick cash and fabulous prizes, the thrill of winning and the lasting joy of this different family make this a wonderful story of dreams unexpectedly fulfilled.</desc><category lang="en">Info</category></programme>

Dvořák&apos;s Golden Spinning Wheel was premiered in private by the orchestra of the Prague Conservatoire conducted by Antonín Bennewitz in 1896. The Czech Philharmonic concludes the program with Mahler&apos;s symphony Das Lied von der Erde. Soloists are Magdalena Kožená (mezzo-soprano) and Simon O&apos;Neill (tenor). In May 1908, Gustav Mahler returned to Europe after his first season in New York and spent the summer holiday in South Tyrol, where he began composing Das Lied von der Erde to texts from the collection Die chinesische Flöte (&apos;The Chinese flute&apos;), adaptations of Chinese poetry by Hans Bethge.

During the height of the California gold rush, the titular heroine must steel herself in the face of adversity in order to win the affections of the man she loves. Despite its glamorised and highly publicised premiere, La Fanciulla del West disappeared from the repertory for a number of decades. Critics argued that despite its traditional handling of the themes of sacrifice and redemption, Fanciulla&apos;s setting was not conducive to grand opera conventions. Equally, the opera&apos;s lead role is notoriously demanding, often making casting difficult. In recent years however, it has returned to popularity, and is now considered amongst Puccini&apos;s great works. This performance features Westbroek (soprano), Jonas Kaufmann (tenor) and Zeljko Lucic (baritone). Recorded at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, United States, in 2018.</desc><category lang="en">Musikspiel</category></programme>

The composer, conductor, cellist, and classical guitarist was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1887. Growing up during a time of immense social change in Brazil – with the abolishment of slavery in 1888, this was a time of social revolution and far-reaching modernizations – Villa-Lobos went on to become one of South America&apos;s best-known composers of all time.

Among them are Kaiser-Walzer, Op. 437, and Schatz-Walzer, Op. 418, from the operetta The Gypsy Baron. In May 1921, the likes of Arnold Schönberg, Alban Berg, and Anton Webern wrote these chamber music arrangements to raise funds for their Society for Private Musical Performances. Although both the concert and the auction of the scores were very successful, the Society eventually went under. In addition to these pieces by Strauss, The Philharmonics perform works by Fritz Kreisler, Leopold Godowsky, as well as The Philharmonics&apos;s first violinist, Tibor Kováč.

Tom Beghin&apos;s new recording of Beethoven&apos;s Piano Sonatas Opus 109, 110, and 111 is an artistic exploration of how Beethoven&apos;s musicking was shaped by the work environment he created with the help of colleagues and friends. Not only does pianist Tom Beghin perform Beethoven&apos;s trilogy of pianistic masterpieces on a magnificent new replica of Beethoven&apos;s Broadwood piano, he uses a reconstruction of the Gehörmaschine that was mounted on the composer&apos;s piano so he could continue to create music as his hearing declined. &apos;You do hear better when you bring your head under this machine, don&apos;t you?&apos; André Stein asked Beethoven. Two centuries later, we too can bring our heads under the machine and wonder: Do we hear Beethoven differently? Beghin draws us inside the hearing machine, where we feel as well as hear the essence of Beethoven&apos;s rambunctious and irresistibly poetic musical vibrations. Inside the Hearing Machine invites us into the multisensory playground of a deaf composer for whom the machine was more than a hearing aid and who interacted with his instrument through much more than sound.</desc><category lang="en">Musik</category></programme>

The concert closes with Stravinsky&apos;s The Rite of Spring which he wrote in 1913 for Sergei Diaghilev&apos;s Ballets Russes. The première caused a lot of sensation and near-riot in the audience because of the avant-garde nature, music and choreography of the piece. The Rite of Spring is now considered as one of the masterpieces of classical music history and has influenced many 20th-century music composers.

The Russian choreograph, and co-librettist of this work was the soloist of the Maryinsky Theatre for 18 years and later for a short time headed its ballet. His first productions at the Kirov were &quot;The Stone Flower&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Love&quot;. They marked the birth of a new choreographer, soon to be known all over the world and of a new trend that for many years determined the development of ballet in Russia. The plot to Golden Age takes place in the 1920&apos;s, in a seaside town in the south of Soviet Russia. This was the period of the New Economic Policy (NEP) which allowed private enterprise and trade and, as a result, shady operators and petty criminals flourished. The Golden Age restaurant is their favorite haunt – here, a young dancer, Rita, who appears under the name of Mademoiselle Margot, and her partner, Jacques, originally named Yashka, leader of a local gang of bandits, entertain a mixed public of &quot;fast livers&quot;. Helping Yashka with his &quot;jobs&quot; are his bandit cronies and his friend, Lyuska. During the town festival and general rejoicing Boris, a young fisherman, member of the satirical agitprop theater for working youths, meets Rita. They begin to fall in love, setting of a chain of events full of intrigues and lovers on the run. Recorded 2016 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow.</desc><category lang="en">Musikspiel</category></programme>

The symphony consists of four movements: Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso, Molto vivace, Adagio molto e cantabile, and Finale. The four vocal soloists are Gulnara Shafigullina (soprano), Claire Barnett-Jones (mezzosoprano), Matthew Newlin (tenor), and Frederik Bergman (baritone).</desc><category lang="en">Musik</category></programme>

Pourtant, ce musicien représente beaucoup plus qu&apos;un seul album. McCann passe facilement d&apos;un style de jazz à un autre, faisant preuve de sa technique impressionnante dans tous les domaines, du bop à la fusion, du chant au clavier et piano électrique, clavinet ou synthétiseur. Son mélange de musique religieuse et musique swing saisit parfaitement l&apos;esprit de l&apos;époque, bien qu&apos;une maladie l&apos;empêchât de jouer avec plus d&apos;un seul doigt au début des années 1990. Pendant ce concert, enregistré en 1983, McCann ramène le gospel à La Nouvelle-Orléans. Le chant de McCann excelle dans les interprétations émouvantes de ses succès, incluant &quot;Just Like Magic&quot;, accompagnées par le magnifique &quot;Magic Band&quot;, composé du saxophoniste Bobby Bryant Jr., du bassiste Curtis Robertson Jr. et du batteur Tony St. James.</desc><category lang="en">Musique</category></programme>
