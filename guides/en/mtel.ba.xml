They hide beneath the surface, in the intricate underwater world of the Delta. Fearsome hippos and man-eating crocodiles guard these waters, and diving here is considered extremely dangerous. Few humans have ever ventured below the surface, until now. A team of film makers armed with experience and a deep knowledge of animal behaviour have dived the delta for the past year. Their experiences reveal a new, unexplored wilderness that is shaped by passage of the delta\&apos;s epic winter flood. Every summer, rains that collect in Angola surge down the Okavango River in a giant pulse. Just as the dry season draws near, that pulse reaches the delta, and sets a chain reaction of life in motion. Landscapes flood as the pulse pushes through, and drain in its wake. These forces shape the lives of every creature in the underwater Okavango. The first to feel the effects of the flood are the cave dwellers. The rising tide lifts vast floating carpets of reeds and papyrus off the sand, creating a labyrinth of caves beneath them. Mormyrids and squeakers hunt in the dark, but the live in fear of a far larger predator. Sharp toothed catfish are amongst the Delta\&apos;s most voracious hunters. They plague the smaller fish, but they in turn are hunted by giant crocodiles. As the pulse pushes into the main delta, tiny fish are sucked into the deep channels behind it. The waters fill with predators that gather to feast on the soup of small fry. The flood keeps pushing further and further out into Botswana, until in the peak of the dry season, it breaks out over dry land. Creatures travel from across Botswana to meet the life-giving tide. Huge elephant breeding herds flee the drought-stricken Kalahari, and walk hundreds of kilometres to reach the flooded delta. Though the water offers life, it harbours death as well. Their tiny infants must navigate crocodile infested floodplains, and face off with lions in the dense reeds. Nowhere is safe, until the flood finally reaches the end of its journey. Just as the rains threaten to bring the dry season to a close, the closing act of the underwater delta launches into action. Birds flock to the disappearing shallows to feast on trapped fish, and the fearsome catfish amass into an army. They charge down the channels by the hundred, and flush fish from the reeds. The stampede of hunters makes the water boil, and entices a new killer to the feast. Fish eagles swoop down one after the other, and snatch catfish from the churning waters. The frenzy of predators builds to a crescendo, until rains finally douse the feast. The wet season marks the end of the flood, but it feeds the beginnings of another. As rainwaters gather once more in the Angolan highlands, the journey of a new pulse begins. This film opens a window on an unexplored landscape of exquisite beauty, and the creatures that must play the daily lottery of life and death within it.</desc><category lang="en">Info</category><icon src="https://mtel.ba/oec/images/epg/308362893.jpg"/></programme>

These likeable creatures have inspired and enthralled us through the ages and have seemingly secured their place beside us as one of the most intelligent mammals on the planet. But how do we measure this intelligence? And how smart are dolphins really? If intelligence is defined by the ability to reason, plan, solve problems and learn from experience, how does the dolphin weigh up? \&quot;Dolphins _ Beauty Before Brains?\&quot; (1 x 52\&apos; HD), takes us on a scientific journey into the complex world of the dolphin and investigates the controversy surrounding Professor Paul Manger\&apos;s recent assertion that dolphins are not quite as smart as we\&apos;d previously thought _ \&quot;dumber than a goldfish\&quot; were the words he used. According to his studies, dolphins appear to have brains that lack complexity at neuronal level, which compromises their information-processing abilities. By examining a series of experiments testing the \&quot;theory of mind\&quot; in dolphins and exploring unique and engaging habits like self-awareness, creative responses and self-entertainment such as wave-riding, this film illustrates exactly where dolphin IQ scores on the charts. We also look at unique behaviour patterns, pod dynamics, communication skills and hunting strategies that play out in mass feeding events such as the Sardine Run on the South African coastline. The dolphins\&apos; Sardine Run behaviour is one of the most amazing spectacles of intelligence and co-operation in the natural world. We then travel to Mozambique to meet Angie Gullan, the \&quot;Dolphin Whisperer\&quot;. She has monitored and interacted with four local pods for the past ten years and facilitates dolphin \&quot;swims\&quot; that are said to have physiological healing effects on human beings. According to her observations, dolphins rank at the top when it comes to emotional intelligence. So is Professor Manger correct in his assessment of dolphins and how does his study compare with the facts? Could dolphin intelligence, or lack thereof, be something that varies from one individual to the next?</desc><category lang="en">Nature + Travels</category><icon src="https://mtel.ba/oec/images/epg/11008557.jpg"/></programme>

Doctors say that consuming a small amount every day is good for your health. Environmental activists and organic wine producers caution that conventional wine is filled with harmful pesticides and that the fertilisers, fungicides and other chemicals used to produce it are disastrous for the environment. Aspiring chefs and restaurateurs Marida Mohammed (MasterChef) and her twin sister, Narida, get advice from celebrity chef and sommelier Vikram Vij, about how to select and appreciate wine and why they shouldn\&apos;t worry too much about purported health threats. Marida and Narida then tour Niagara vineyards and compare super-‐organic, biodynamic wine with its conventional counterpart. Ann Sperling of Southbrook Vineyards combines cosmic forces with organic farming to produce wine she calls the purest expression of the grape that is good for the people who drink it and the planet as a whole. French winemaker JL Groux of Stratus Vineyards and George Soleas, the Vice President of the LCBO argue that conventional wine is delicious and safe for both you and the environment.

The main reason for their extinction is that their natural habitat is being destroyed for the more profitable cultivation of palm oil plantations. By today already 70 % of the Sumatran Island is already covered by palm oil trees. In addition most of the local population sees them more as an object of entertainment rather than a national heritage which is worth being protected. Since that common attitude in society is even changing it could still come too late for those anthropoid apes. Ian Singleton who moved here from England is dedicating his life to the care of these apes.
