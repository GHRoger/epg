They are stranded in remote, dangerous locations without any clothing, food or water and the viewer watches as the adventurers struggle to survive in these hostile environments. As well as the physical difficulties involved by being alone and trying to gather food, water and shelter, perhaps the greatest challenge is dealing with the psychological stresses of complete solitude. Episodes include expert survivalist Lacey Jones being surrounded by lions and hyenas in the African bush; outdoorsman Ryan Holt eating contaminated fruit in South Africa and vowing to only eat meat thereafter; and EJ Snyder having to cope with packs of wolves and wild boars in the Bulgarian mountains.</desc></programme>

They hide beneath the surface, in the intricate underwater world of the Delta. Fearsome hippos and man-eating crocodiles guard these waters, and diving here is considered extremely dangerous. Few humans have ever ventured below the surface, until now. A team of film makers armed with experience and a deep knowledge of animal behaviour have dived the delta for the past year. Their experiences reveal a new, unexplored wilderness that is shaped by passage of the delta&apos;s epic winter flood. Every summer, rains that collect in Angola surge down the Okavango River in a giant pulse. Just as the dry season draws near, that pulse reaches the delta, and sets a chain reaction of life in motion. Landscapes flood as the pulse pushes through, and drain in its wake. These forces shape the lives of every creature in the underwater Okavango. The first to feel the effects of the flood are the cave dwellers. The rising tide lifts vast floating carpets of reeds and papyrus off the sand, creating a labyrinth of caves beneath them. Mormyrids and squeakers hunt in the dark, but the live in fear of a far larger predator. Sharp toothed catfish are amongst the Delta&apos;s most voracious hunters. They plague the smaller fish, but they in turn are hunted by giant crocodiles. As the pulse pushes into the main delta, tiny fish are sucked into the deep channels behind it. The waters fill with predators that gather to feast on the soup of small fry. The flood keeps pushing further and further out into Botswana, until in the peak of the dry season, it breaks out over dry land. Creatures travel from across Botswana to meet the life-giving tide. Huge elephant breeding herds flee the drought-stricken Kalahari, and walk hundreds of kilometres to reach the flooded delta. Though the water offers life, it harbours death as well. Their tiny infants must navigate crocodile infested floodplains, and face off with lions in the dense reeds. Nowhere is safe, until the flood finally reaches the end of its journey. Just as the rains threaten to bring the dry season to a close, the closing act of the underwater delta launches into action. Birds flock to the disappearing shallows to feast on trapped fish, and the fearsome catfish amass into an army. They charge down the channels by the hundred, and flush fish from the reeds. The stampede of hunters makes the water boil, and entices a new killer to the feast. Fish eagles swoop down one after the other, and snatch catfish from the churning waters. The frenzy of predators builds to a crescendo, until rains finally douse the feast. The wet season marks the end of the flood, but it feeds the beginnings of another. As rainwaters gather once more in the Angolan highlands, the journey of a new pulse begins. This film opens a window on an unexplored landscape of exquisite beauty, and the creatures that must play the daily lottery of life and death within it.</desc></programme>

These likeable creatures have inspired and enthralled us through the ages and have seemingly secured their place beside us as one of the most intelligent mammals on the planet. But how do we measure this intelligence? And how smart are dolphins really? If intelligence is defined by the ability to reason, plan, solve problems and learn from experience, how does the dolphin weigh up? &quot;Dolphins – Beauty Before Brains?&quot; (1 x 52&apos; HD), takes us on a scientific journey into the complex world of the dolphin and investigates the controversy surrounding Professor Paul Manger&apos;s recent assertion that dolphins are not quite as smart as we&apos;d previously thought – &quot;dumber than a goldfish&quot; were the words he used. According to his studies, dolphins appear to have brains that lack complexity at neuronal level, which compromises their information-processing abilities. By examining a series of experiments testing the &quot;theory of mind&quot; in dolphins and exploring unique and engaging habits like self-awareness, creative responses and self-entertainment such as wave-riding, this film illustrates exactly where dolphin IQ scores on the charts. We also look at unique behaviour patterns, pod dynamics, communication skills and hunting strategies that play out in mass feeding events such as the Sardine Run on the South African coastline. The dolphins&apos; Sardine Run behaviour is one of the most amazing spectacles of intelligence and co-operation in the natural world. We then travel to Mozambique to meet Angie Gullan, the &quot;Dolphin Whisperer&quot;. She has monitored and interacted with four local pods for the past ten years and facilitates dolphin &quot;swims&quot; that are said to have physiological healing effects on human beings. According to her observations, dolphins rank at the top when it comes to emotional intelligence. So is Professor Manger correct in his assessment of dolphins and how does his study compare with the facts? Could dolphin intelligence, or lack thereof, be something that varies from one individual to the next?</desc></programme>

According to pessimistic evaluations the chances of this threatened species to survive seem rather limited. The main reason for their extinction is that their natural habitat is being destroyed for the more profitable cultivation of palm oil plantations. By today already 70 % of the Sumatran Island is already covered by palm oil trees. In addition most of the local population sees them more as an object of entertainment rather than a national heritage which is worth being protected. Since that common attitude in society is even changing it could still come too late for those anthropoid apes. Ian Singleton who moved here from England is dedicating his life to the care of these apes. Since 20 years, he is working to facilitate a refuge for the last ones of their kind so they could live again untroubled in Nature and maybe even decrease their population</desc></programme>

Incorporating six stages over six days, the race weaves its way up and down the Andalucia mountains at a blistering pace, routing through spectacular trails and sensational views. Elite and masters race categories offer individual and team leader board standings, with daily stage prizes, overall medals and prize money for the elite UCI riders. The pace of the competition never slows across the six stages, kicking off with the stage 1 time trial; a short, fast and intense &apos;flash stage&apos;, featuring single tracks mixed with overtaking sections. Five days, 32 kilometres and over 6,590 meters of ascent later, the 57.8km &quot;finisher&quot; stage 6 is the final test, as riders climb over 1,396 meters up the mythical Reventón and pass through Trasierra, before descending and finishing along Santo Domingo&apos;s unforgettable single-track trail. Riders choose their risks to secure an advantage, all the time fully conscious that one mistake navigating the rocky trails means their race is over. Winning this 9th edition of the Andalucia Bike Race, were Spain&apos;s David Valero in the men&apos;s elite, with Hildegunn Hovdenak of Norway tacking victory in the women&apos;s elite.</desc></programme>

Incorporating six stages over six days, the race weaves its way up and down the Andalucia mountains at a blistering pace, routing through spectacular trails and sensational views. Elite and masters race categories offer individual and team leader board standings, with daily stage prizes, overall medals and prize money for the elite UCI riders. The pace of the competition never slows across the six stages, kicking off with the stage 1 time trial; a short, fast and intense &apos;flash stage&apos;, featuring single tracks mixed with overtaking sections. Five days, 32 kilometres and over 6,590 meters of ascent later, the 57.8km &quot;finisher&quot; stage 6 is the final test, as riders climb over 1,396 meters up the mythical Reventón and pass through Trasierra, before descending and finishing along Santo Domingo&apos;s unforgettable single-track trail. Riders choose their risks to secure an advantage, all the time fully conscious that one mistake navigating the rocky trails means their race is over. Winning this 9th edition of the Andalucia Bike Race, were Spain&apos;s David Valero in the men&apos;s elite, with Hildegunn Hovdenak of Norway tacking victory in the women&apos;s elite.</desc></programme>

The keyboard prodigy plunges frantically into the strings of the acoustic piano and chooses the trio as a formula to revive the repertoire of the pianist with brittle bones, and shows us – if needs be – that jazz is a language that he negotiates with masterly hands (left included). Coulondre elegantly composes and arranges a solar and generous repertoire, equal to the height of genius. Steeped in the creativity and harmony long promoted by Petrucciani, this homage reflects the perfect osmosis between volcanic rhythm and subtle melodies.

Pillar of the great Cuban jazz school, the double bassist based in Paris has decided to turn his accidental return to his native country into art in times of pandemic. While Cuba was completely closing in on itself to absorb the global disruption, he composed five superb musical pieces, which he created for Banlieues Bleues with his faithful trio and a distinguished guest, also from Cuba, the choreographer and dancer Judith Sanchez Ruiz.

This film played a major part in that success. His rare combination of astonishing technical virtuosity and lighthearted ebullience have since won him a particularly affectionate following, but he wears his success very easily and describes himself as basically a family man and his relationship with his family as the most important thing in his life. This film, which was shot over a period of three years, shows Itzhak Perlman at home in New York with his family, on tour in Europe with Pinchas Zukerman, playing Sarasate&apos;s &quot;Zigeunerweisen&quot; with the Philharmonia Orchestra of London, conducted by Lawrence Foster, in the recording studios with Vladimir Ashkenazy, recording Beethoven sonatas, playing Scott Joplin in Wuppertal with Bruno Canino, solo Bach at a BBC Lunchtime Concert in St John&apos;s, Smith Square, London, a Beethoven Trio with Vladimir Ashkenazy and Lynn Harrell in concert at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and rehearsing, performing and teaching at the Aspen Music School in Colorado, where he goes regularly with his entire family. This film is an intimate portrait of this entertaining and many-faceted artist and it includes music by Bazzini, Sarasate, Beethoven, Scott Joplin, Bach and Vivaldi with a number of performances shot on stage in true concert conditions, where the artist is at his best and most revealing.</desc></programme>
