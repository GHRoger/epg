They hide beneath the surface, in the intricate underwater world of the Delta. Fearsome hippos and man-eating crocodiles guard these waters, and diving here is considered extremely dangerous. Few humans have ever ventured below the surface, until now. A team of film makers armed with experience and a deep knowledge of animal behaviour have dived the delta for the past year. Their experiences reveal a new, unexplored wilderness that is shaped by passage of the delta&apos;s epic winter flood. Every summer, rains that collect in Angola surge down the Okavango River in a giant pulse. Just as the dry season draws near, that pulse reaches the delta, and sets a chain reaction of life in motion. Landscapes flood as the pulse pushes through, and drain in its wake.

According to pessimistic evaluations the chances of this threatened species to survive seem rather limited. The main reason for their extinction is that their natural habitat is being destroyed for the more profitable cultivation of palm oil plantations. By today already 70 % of the Sumatran Island is already covered by palm oil trees. In addition most of the local population sees them more as an object of entertainment rather than a national heritage which is worth being protected. Since that common attitude in society is even changing it could still come too late for those anthropoid apes. Ian Singleton who moved here from England is dedicating his life to the care of these apes. Since 20 years, he is working to facilitate a refuge for the last ones of their kind so they could live again untroubled in Nature and maybe even decrease their population</desc></programme>

Because of an external event, each of them will leave their environment and undergo an experience that confronts them with the uncomfortable and dangerous dimensions of their shared urban space.

From Tic-Tac-Dough in 1956 to Jeopardy in 1967 to Trivial Pursuit in 1993, they competed on national television 28 times -- probably the longest-running record of individual TV game show appearances by husband and wife in the world. Daughter Patricia melds 10 different TV game shows and a snappy soundtrack with vivid motion graphics and vintage footage to paint an intimate portrait of her quirky parents, paradigms of 20th century family life. Yet -- as their poignant romance and ribald experiences reveal the fascinating historical context of their times -- the winning couple also come to be seen as curiously-relatable outsiders to mainstream culture. Themes of love, hardship, and achievement add emotional weight to Bernard&apos;s parting words, &apos;If it&apos;s a lucky life, it&apos;s mine.&apos; Quick cash and fabulous prizes, the thrill of winning and the lasting joy of this different family make this a...</desc><credits><director>Patricia Boiko</director><actor>Liz Burdick</actor></credits><date>20150101</date></programme>
